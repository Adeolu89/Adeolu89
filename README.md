ðŸ“Š Aspiring **Data Scientist | Data Engineer | Data Analyst**  

I have a deep appreciation for storiesâ€”whether theyâ€™re told through music, film, or simply shared by a friend. I believe there are countless stories hidden within data, and my passion lies in uncovering them to create a difference wherever I find myself.
