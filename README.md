My name is Adeolu and I'm a Statistics + Computing minor student at the University of Waterloo.

I'm interested in Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and I'm looking to develop meaningful skills in these areas of technology.

I'm currently learning Python and it's libraries for Data Science like NumPy, Pandas, Mtplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn and more, I'm also learning SQL and I hope to learn more tools and technologies that will aid my Data Science journey
